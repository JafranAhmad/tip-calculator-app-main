### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person


### Workflow

To use the tip calculator, you will need to enter the bill amount, then the number of people then LASTLY the tip amount. For some reason that is the only way it will work. If you don't enter the information accordingly, NaN will be displayed as the tip calculation.
